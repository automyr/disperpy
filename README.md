# disperpy
Proof-of-concept Python implementation of client-side logic for file-sharing using the IOTA Tangle

 - Install python 3.6 - you can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
 - Install pip - already comes with any version of python >=3.4, so you don't need to do anything.
 - Install pipenv - Open a cmd/terminal and write `pip install pipenv` - This is optional, but I recommend doing this instead of using the requirements.txt file.
 - Clone this repo to any folder, then just call `pipenv install` from inside that folder (where the pipfile and pipfile.lock are).
    - If you want to mess around with the code, which at this point in time is the only reason to do all this ^, you should instead call `pipenv install --dev` to also install the testing framework I'm using.
